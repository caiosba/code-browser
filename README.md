## Code Browser

### About

Code Browser is a system to show visual information about open source repositories
and code. It aims to be a browser extension that sends information to a backend system,
which will generate statistics about the current site being visited. Current supported
sites are: Github, Gitorious and Google Code (Git repositories only). The visualizations
will use OpenedEyes and D3.js libraries. On the backend, Git itself and Analyzo will be
used to generate data.

### How to run the backend

* Run `bundle install` to install missing gems
* Edit config/database.yml to configure you database
* Run `rake db:migrate` to create the tables in the database
* Start the server: `rails s`
* Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### How to run the frontend

Install the Google Chrome extension that lives on `frontend` directory.
