## Code Browser

### About

Code Browser is a system to show visual information about open source repositories
and code. It aims to be a browser extension that sends information to a backend system,
which will generate statistics about the current site being visited. Current supported
sites is Github, but it is very easy to extend by adding support to other sites.
The visualizations use OpenedEyes and D3.js libraries. On the backend, Git itself and Analizo are
used to generate data.
